# zoom-error

Vue + Vite app template

* Vue 3
* Vite 2

## Getting Started

> Note to Vue users: Vite currently only works with Vue 3.x. This also means you can't use libraries that are not yet compatible with Vue 3.

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine before proceeding.

Click the Use this template button and clone the repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:uw-it-aca/zoom-login-statics.git
$ cd zoom-login-statics
$ npm install

```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
$ npm run dev
```

You can view the development build here: http://localhost:3000/unauthorized-user/

### Compiles and minifies for production
Configure vite.config.js for specific build options. This produces the final bundle released in production.
```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

You can preview it here: http://localhost:8000/unauthorized-user
